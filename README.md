# mareoraft's dotfiles

n*x config files and dotfiles that I store in my home directory

NOTE.  Apparently there are other dotfiles frameworks that already exist such as https://github.com/wking/dotfiles-framework and it would be good to see which one is best and use that.

I am using a gitignore WHITELIST, so it *should* be safe for this repo to sit here in my home folder.

The end goal of this project is to make it so that whenever I am on a new box, I can just clone this repository and be ready to go with personal settings.

## config directory

All configuration files (aka "dotfiles") are located here.  This is the *content* that you wish to sync across computers.
